- **Dispute/Differing Viewpoints:** However some think the game in the 1950 World Cup between England and the USA was the biggest upest in World Cup history. The game ended 1-0 to the US and the press, assuming a misprint reported England instead had won 10-1. 

- **Question 4:** Should the World Cup be held every two years instead of four?  
- **Answer:** In my opinion I think the World Cup should still be help every 4 years. I believe the exictment of the World Cup would decrease if it happens more often.

- **Dispute/Differing Viewpoints:** If the World Cup happens every 2 years would give more opportunities for players and countries to play more often. 
Wenger claims that the "beauty and prestige of a tournament" depends on its quality rather than how often it occurs and suggests that playing every two years will give the world high-class international fixtures and memorable tournaments.

- **Question 5:** Which World Cup team was the greatest of all time?  
- **Answer:** In my opinion the Brazilian squad of 1970 is the greatest World Cup team in history. This squad had legendary players such as Pelé, Jairzinho, Tostão, Rivelino, and Carlos Alberto. They were victorious 4-1 in the final against Itly. This victory made Brazil's national team the first nation in history to win the World Cup three times.

- **Dispute/Differing Viewpoints:** While the 1970's Brazil squad is often celerbrated for being the greatest, other historical teams have strong performances in World Cup history. For example the Brazilian squad of 1958 as a young Pele at the age of 17 lead Brazil to beat Swedean to win thier first ever World Cup title.  

- **Question 6:** What was the most controversial moment in World Cup history?  
- **Answer:** The most controversial moment took place at 1934 World Cup, hosted by Italy. During the tournament Italy under the leadership of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini wanted to show national strength. The Italian team known as Azzuri, performed many fouls on purpose to promote Mussolini's propaganda rather than a fair sporting event.

- **Dispute/Differing Viewpoints:** In truth very little is known about the events of the actual games. Without television, excpet for the ones present at the match actually know the details do the match. The reality of the games were largly shaped by media personalities and press that reported on the matches. (Keywords:

- **Question 7:** Does the World Cup cause more unity or division ?
- **Answer:**  In my opinion the World Cup brings more unity to the world by uniting together countires from all over the world to play one sport- soccer. Soccer is a celebration of joy, hope, and health proving that it is bigger than a sport. FIFA states that soccer shows benefits of physical activity, team spirit, and respect.

- **Dispute/Differing Viewpoints:** 

- **Question 8:** Should the World Cup allow more teams to compete?  
- **Answer:** In my opinion yes they should allow more teams to compete in the World Cup. If your a country that never made it to the World Cup the chances of qualifying are more likely as more teams will be added to the competition. Even with the expansion of the teams from 32 to 48 included the days of the tournment would still be only 32 the same amount of days as the original.

- **Dispute/Differing Viewpoints:** While adding teams would increase the number of games it still creates a problem. The more poor quality teams would be rewarded as the World Cup group table has 4 teams in each group with the top 2 advancing so increases the number of teams would give more chances to qualify to the next round. 

- **Question 9:** What is the best World Cup goal ever scored?  
- **Answer:** In my opinion the goal scored by James Rodriguez for Colombia agianst Uruguay placed 4th on the list is the greatest World Cup Goal. He stunned the crowd with a exceptional strike, controlling the ball with his chest just ouside the D, then does a unstoppable volly into the back of the Uruguray's teams net.

- **Dispute/Differing Viewpoints:** Others believe Maradona's goal against England in the 1986 World Cup was better. Shearer and Lineker the players at the time who played for England in this match described it as "genius" and "your simply in awe". 

- **Question 10:** Has the introduction of VAR improved referees' decision-making during the 2018 World Cup?  
- **Answer:** In my opinion VAR has not improved referee decision making during the events of the 2018 World Cup. I beleive VAR takes away the humane aspect of the game and converts it more robotic. 
- **Source:** [VAR in the World Cup - Analysis by The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/)  ("Keywords: VAR World Cup")
- **Dispute/Differing Viewpoints:** While critics argue that VAR has not improved and takes away the referee's decisions others beleive VAR's accuracy leads to a more fairer game.
